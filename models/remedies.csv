Healthy,"Ensure proper pruning, balanced fertilization, and adequate watering. Maintain good air circulation around the tree."
Rust,"Remove infected leaves and branches immediately. Apply copper-based or synthetic fungicides "
Powdery,"Remove infected leaves.Apply copper-based or synthetic fungicides"
Apple_Black_rot,"Remove infected leaves and branches immediately. Apply copper-based or synthetic fungicides (e.g., Captan) during bud break and repeat every 7-14 days."
Apple_Cedar_apple_rust,"Manage by removing juniper hosts near apple trees. Use resistant apple varieties. Apply fungicides (like Myclobutanil) starting at pink bud stage."
Apple_Healthy,"Ensure proper pruning, balanced fertilization, and adequate watering. Maintain good air circulation around the tree."
Corn_maize_Common_rust,"Use rust-resistant varieties if available. For severe cases, apply fungicides containing active ingredients like Azoxystrobin or Propiconazole."
Corn_maize_Gray_leaf_spot,"Use crop rotation with non-host crops. Apply appropriate fungicides when disease symptoms first appear, focusing on protecting the upper leaves."
Corn_maize_Northern_Leaf_Blight,"Plant resistant hybrids. Manage crop residue to reduce initial inoculum. Apply protective fungicides if necessary, following recommended timing."
Potato_Early_blight,"Practice 2-3 year crop rotation. Avoid overhead watering to reduce leaf wetness. Apply protective fungicides (Chlorothalonil or Mancozeb) starting when symptoms first appear."
Potato_Late_blight,"Use copper-based sprays preventatively. Remove and destroy all infected foliage and tubers immediately. Ensure adequate spacing for air circulation."
Potato_Healthy,"Ensure well-drained soil, balanced NPK fertilization, and avoid water stress. Use certified, disease-free seed potatoes."
Tomato_Bacterial_spot,"Apply copper products in combination with mancozeb. Use disease-free seeds and transplants. Avoid working in the field when foliage is wet."
Tomato_Late_blight,"Use copper-based spray (e.g., Bordeaux mixture) and remove severely infected plants. Ensure good airflow and proper plant spacing."
Tomato_Leaf_Mold,"Improve air circulation by pruning and spacing. Apply fungicides (like Mancozeb or Chlorothalonil) if cultural practices are insufficient."
Tomato_Mosaic_virus,"Immediately remove and destroy infected plants, as there is no chemical cure. Control insect vectors (aphids) and sterilize tools after use."
Tomato_Healthy,"Provide consistent, deep watering and use stakes or cages to keep vines off the ground. Prune lower leaves for better air movement."
Grape_Black_rot,"Apply fungicides containing active ingredients like strobilurins or triazoles starting early in the season, typically every 7-14 days until harvest."
Grape_Esca_Black_Measles,"No chemical cure; prune out and destroy diseased wood in winter. Protect large pruning cuts with fungicidal sealant."
Grape_Healthy,"Maintain vineyard hygiene, prune appropriately, and ensure optimal soil health and drainage."
